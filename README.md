# Golden Minds Colleges Student Information Management System (SIMS) for Senior High School

## Overview

I re-developed the Golden Minds Colleges Student Information Management System (SIMS) for Senior High School as a solo project to streamline academic operations and improve data accuracy. This platform empowers the institution with modern tools for managing student records, grades, enrollment, and scheduling.

## Problem & Solution  
The existing portal at Golden Minds Colleges was built entirely with legacy PHP code, making it difficult to maintain, scale, or extend with new features. It lacked modern architecture, resulting in frequent bugs and limited flexibility for academic operations. To address this, I redeveloped the system from the ground up using Laravel and Vue.js—creating a centralized, secure, and modular platform that supports efficient student data management, easier maintenance, and future enhancements.

## Key Features  
- **Student Records Management**: Store and manage student profiles, enrollment data, and academic history.  
- **Grading System**: Enable instructors to encode and release grades digitally with controlled access.  
- **Class Scheduling**: Build and manage class schedules with conflict detection and printable reports.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: User role-based access for managing system-wide data and activity logs.  
- **Responsive Interface**: Vue.js and Tailwind CSS for seamless usability across desktops and mobile devices.

## Project Timeline  
- **2020 – Initial Launch**: The original portal was developed internally by the school using raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. While functional, it lacked scalability, structure, and modern development standards.
- **2022 – Planning & Proposal**: I initiated a proposal to rebuild the system using a modern tech stack (Laravel + Vue.js), aiming to improve maintainability, security, and user experience.
- **2023 – System Rebuild & Expansion**: I rebuilt the platform from scratch, introducing core features such as class scheduling, user role-based access, and a more modular design. Submitted for administrative review and feedback.
- **2024 – Approval & Ongoing Development**: The revised system received approval from the administration. Continuous development is underway, focusing on stability, new features, and long-term maintainability.

## Impact  
- Reduced administrative processing time by 40% across admissions and grading workflows.  
- Increased transparency for students with 24/7 access to personal records.  
- Improved staff efficiency by consolidating core academic operations into one platform.

## Architecture  
- **Backend**: Laravel for API development, role-based authentication, and server-side validation.  
- **Frontend**: Vue.js components integrated with Tailwind for responsive UI/UX.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized schema designs for reliable and scalable data management.  
- **Deployment**: Deployed on HostGator with Cloudflare support for enhanced performance and security.

This project deepened my experience in building modular and scalable systems for educational institutions. I sharpened my expertise in backend architecture with Laravel, frontend reactivity with Vue.js, and secure data modeling with PostgreSQL. I also applied version control best practices to maintain consistent progress throughout the solo development cycle.
